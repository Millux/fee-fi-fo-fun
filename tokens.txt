has
taken
them
all
by
force
from
people
whom

jack
was
delighted
at
idea
of
this
adventure
set
off
in
high
spirits
towards
castle
castle
was
farther
off
than
had
thought
by
time
reached
gates
it
was
so
late
that
made
up
his
mind
ask
for
a
nights
lodging
there
was
a
woman
standing
in
doorway
but
when
jack
made
his
request
she
was
very
frightened
said
indeed
i
dare
not
take
you
in
give
you
food
lodging
my
husband
is
an
ogre
who
lives
on
human
flesh
if
were
find
you
here
would
think
nothing
of
eating
you
up
in
three
mouthfuls
i
advise
you
go
away
at
once
before
comes
home
but
when
she
saw
how
tired
hungry
jack
really
was
she
took
him
into
house
gave
him
plenty
eat
drink
while
jack
was
eating
his
food
in
kitchen
there
came
a
loud
knocking
at
door
ogres
wife
in
a
great
flurry
hid
jack
in
oven
then
hurried
let
her
husband
in
jack
peeped
through
oven
door
saw
a
terriblelooking
ogre
who
came
stamping
into
kitchen
said
in
a
voice
like
thunder
wife
i
smell
fresh
meat
it
is
only
people
you
are
fattening
in
dungeon
said
wife
so
ogre
sat
down
ate
his
supper
after
supper
commanded
his
wife
bring
him
his
moneybags
then
began
count
his
moneythousands
thousands
of
pieces
of
gold
silver
illustration
jack
wished
could
take
some
of
this
money
home
his
mother
presently
when
ogre
fell
asleep
crept
out
of
his
hidingplace
hoisting
bags
upon
his
shoulder
slipped
quietly
away
with
them
ogre
was
snoring
so
loudly
that
it
sounded
like
wind
in
chimney
on
a
stormy
night
so
never
heard
little
noise
jack
made
jack
got
safely
away
escaped
down
beanstalk
his
mother
was
overjoyed
see
him
for
she
had
been
very
anxious
about
him
when
did
not
come
home
night
before
she
was
delighted
with
bags
of
money
which
were
enough
keep
them
in
comfort
luxury
for
some
time
for
many
months
jack
his
mother
lived
happily
together
but
after
a
while
money
came
an
end
jack
made
up
his
mind
climb
beanstalk
again
carry
off
some
more
of
ogres
treasures
so
one
morning
got
up
early
put
on
a
different
suit
of
clothes
so
that
ogres
wife
should
not
recognize
him
set
out
climb
beanstalk

at

very
top
found
himself
in
ogres
country
again
when
reached
castle
ogres
wife
was
again
standing
in
doorway
but
when
jack
asked
for
a
nights
lodging
she
said
she
dared
not
give
him
one
for
only
a
few
months
before
she
had
taken
in
a
poor
boy
who
seemed
half
dead
with
fatigue
hunger
in
return
for
her
kindness
had
stolen
some
of
her
husbands
money
run
away
in
night
but
jack
begged
so
hard
that
at
last
she
relented
she
gave
him
a
good
supper
hid
him
in
a
closet
before
her
husband
came
home
presently
there
was
a
great
noise
outside
heavy
footsteps
that
shook
castle
its
foundations
it
was
ogre
come
home
as
soon
as
entered
kitchen
sniffed
suspiciously
said
i
smell
fresh
meat
it
is
only
crows
on
housetops
said
his
wife
they
have
brought
home
a
piece
of
carrion
for
their
young
after
supper
ogre
told
his
wife
fetch
his
hen
this
hen
was
a
very
wonderful
bird
whenever
ogre
said
lay
she
laid
an
egg
of
solid
gold
jack
thought
that
if
could
only
get
this
wonderful
hen
take
home
his
mother
they
would
never
want
any
more
so
when
ogre
fell
asleepas
did
after
a
little
whilehe
came
out
of
closet
seizing
hen
in
his
arms
made
off
with
her
hen
squawked
but
ogres
snoring
was
like
roaring
of
sea
when
tide
is
coming
in
jack
got
safely
down
beanstalk
hen
laid
so
many
golden
eggs
that
jack
his
mother
became
quite
rich
prosperous
there
was
really
no
need
for
jack
go
again
ogres
country
but
liked
danger
excitement
remembered
that
fairy
had
told
him
take
as
many
of
ogres
treasures
as
could
at
last
without
saying
a
word
anybody
started
off
once
more
climb
magic
beanstalk

at
last
reached
very
tiptop
stood
in
ogres
country
this
time
when
reached
castle
began
be
afraid
that
ogres
wife
really
would
not
let
him
in
indeed

i
dare
not
she
said
twice
lately
have
i
given
shelter
a
wayfaring
youth
each
time
stole
some
of
my
husbands
treasures
made
off
with
them
now
my
husband
has
forbidden
me
on
pain
of
instant
death

food
or

any

jack

of
all
his
wife
could
say
insisted
upon
searching

jack
was
in
a
terrible
fright
whilst
was
hunting
but
fortunately
forgot
look
in

a
time
sat
down
his
supper
when
supper
was
over
ogre
told
his
wife
fetch
his
harp
jack
peeped
out
of
copper
saw
harp
brought
in
set
down
before
ogre
it
was
marvelously
made
when
ogre
said
play
it
played
finest
music
without
being
touched
jack
was
enchanted
for
had
never
before
heard
such
wonderful
music
felt
that
must
have
harp
for
his
own
ogre
was
soon
lulled
sleep
by
sweet
sound
of
harp
when
was
snoring
heavily
jack
crept
out
of
copper
taking
up
harp
was
about
make
off
with
it
but
harp
was
a
fairy
harp
it
called
out
loudly
master
master
master
although
ogre
was
snoring
so
noisily
that
it
was
like
sound
of
a
hundred
dragons
roaring
at
once

jacks
dismay
horror
heard
voice
of
his
harp
starting
his
feet
with
a
bellow
of
anger

after
daring
thief

ran
faster
than
had
ever
run
in
his
life
beforestill
carrying
precious
harpwhile
ogre
ran
after
him
shouting
roaring
making
such
a
noise
that
it
sounded
like
a
thousand
thunder
storms
all
going
at
once
if
had
not
drunk
so
much
wine
for
supper
ogre
must
very
soon
have
caught
jack
but
as
it
was
wine
had
got
into
his
head
so
could
not
run
nearly
so
fast
as
usual
jack
reached
beanstalk
just
in
front
of
him
it
was
a
very
close
shave
jack
slid
down
beanstalk
at
his
top
speed
calling
at
top
of
his
voice
for
his
mother
